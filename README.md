# Project Requirements:

For this project, three Classes had to be made:

- Person: Has a name, age, height, and ability to drive a stick shift (yes or no).
- Car: Has a make, model, year, color, headroom, transmission (manual or automatic), and a driver who is a Person.
- CarAndDriver: Has runnable interface main() method.

Both Car and Person must demonstrate encapsulation and have a toString() method.

## Purpose:

  When run, three Car Class objects are created with all their details already assigned. 
The user is then prompted to input the details for three Person Class objects
that will be assigned to each one of the cars. Finally, a report is printed
detailing the values of each car and their assigned driver. Also, in the case
that a driver is either too tall for the car or is assigned to a manual transmission
car without the ability to drive it, an error will be printed alongside the report.
